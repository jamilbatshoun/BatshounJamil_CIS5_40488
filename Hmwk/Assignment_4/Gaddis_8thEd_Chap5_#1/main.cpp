/* 
 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Jamil Batshoun
 * Created on January 18, 2017, 12:29 PM 
 * Purpose: Sum of Numbers
 * Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program 
 * should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number 
 * entered. For example, if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1,
 * 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50.
 * Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number.
