 * Purpose:  Male and Female Percentages
 * Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of 
 * females registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of 
 * males and females in the class.
 * Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 
 * students in the class. The percentage of males can be calculated as 8 รท 20 = 
 * 0.4, or 40%. The percentage of females can be calculated as 12 รท 20 = 0.6, or 
 * 60%.
