 * Purpose: Box Office
 * A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket 
 * sales. The remainder goes to the movie distributor. Write a program that 
 * calculates a theater’s gross and net box office profit for a night. The 
 * program should ask for the name of the movie, and how many adult and child 
 * tickets were sold. (The price of an adult ticket is $10.00 and a child’s 
 * ticket is $6.00.) It should display a report similar to
 * Movie Name: “Wheels of Fury”
 * Adult Tickets Sold: 382
 * Child Tickets Sold: 127
 * Gross Box Office Profit: $ 4582.00
 * Net Box Office Profit: $ 916.40
 * Amount Paid to Distributor: $ 3665.60
 * NOTE: Assume the theater keeps 20 percent of the gross box office profit.
