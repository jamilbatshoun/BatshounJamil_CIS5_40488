 * Purpose: Miles per Gallon
 * Write a program that calculates a carâ€™s gas mileage. The program should ask 
 * the user to enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the 
 * number of miles it can  be driven on a full tank. It should then display the 
 * number of miles that may be driven per gallon of gas.
